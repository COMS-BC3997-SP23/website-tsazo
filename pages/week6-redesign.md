# Redesign

### Summary

I didn't like the direction of how the site was turning out so I spent this week redesigning a site I felt more proud of. This also let me implement a few new design nice-to-haves at this stage like an animated on-hover design and active page design. I also created an animated header bar to hide on scroll.
