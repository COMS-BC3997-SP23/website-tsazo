# Midterm Presentation

### Summary

For my class project, I decieded to create a business website to help market and streamline appointments to a small tailor shop. This tailor shop is named Magic Tailor's and is owned by a woman named Geni Cespedes in Rockville Centre, Long Island.

#### Who is Geni?

Geni is an immigrant from Bolivia. She moved here 35 years ago and found work in being a seamstress. With the help of her husband, she started Magic Tailor's after years of honing in her skills and saving up the income.

_Color Palette_

Lastly, to make sure I don't go crazy with colors across the site, I wanted to cement a color palette that the tailor shop already uses to reflect it in the site itself.

**Week 4: AWS API Struggles**
I don't have an image showing the visible process, but I needed to see how to ensure AWS could connect to Google Places API and I was able to make the connection here! This is to add reviews to the page (hopefully).

# Perfection is the enemy of progress.
