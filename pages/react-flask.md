# Setting up the basics

### Summary

- Followed most of [this React & Flask tutorial](https://dev.to/nagatodev/how-to-connect-flask-to-reactjs-1k8i) to set up both the front and back end of the website.

![Flask bug](../assets/img/week1/flaskBug.png)

- Ran into an issue of flask not being imported properly? VS Code giving me a run for my money even though the installation was as simple as [following the official Flask installation.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#)

  - I thought there were issues with Flask, but instead the IDE was giving non-fatal warnings that didnâ€™t affect the local development server. Server ran on http://localhost:5000 without any problems.

- Ran into a seemingly easy (but annoying) CORS error but it was as simple as switching the proxy URL from http://localhost:3000 to http://127.0.0.1:5000

  - [Stack Overflow CORS Fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45367298/could-not-proxy-request-pusher-auth-from-localhost3000-to-http-localhost500)
  - [GitHub CORS Fix](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/discussions/10149)

- Ultimately created my first React Flask app
